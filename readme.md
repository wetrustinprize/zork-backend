# What is Zork?

This is a simple project I made to learn how to develop backend using Node.js + Typescript.

Zork is a simple service to trade points with your friends, or ask points from them.

# How to run

First of all, you need to install packages using your favorite package manager, in my case: yarn.

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, you can start the server by typing: (_the server will listen on port 3000_)

```bash
yarn dev
```
